 ### Overview
 In my pursuit of continuous learning as a software engineer, I undertook the development of a Java-based project with the aim of advancing my skills and gaining a deeper understanding of the language. The software I created is a practical demonstration of a Contact Manager application, providing users with the ability to seamlessly add, edit, delete, search, and display contacts. This project served as a hands-on exploration of Java syntax and object-oriented programming concepts, enriching my knowledge in these fundamental aspects of software development.

### Development Environment
 For the development of this software, I chose to work within the Visual Studio Code IDE, leveraging its versatility and support for Java development. The choice of Visual Studio Code was driven by its popularity, ease of use, and the availability of the Java Extension Pack, which streamlined the development process.
The programming language used for this project is Java. I opted for the Java language due to its widespread use, platform independence, and robust support for object-oriented programming principles. The application does not rely on external libraries, keeping it simple and focused on core Java concepts.

### Future Work
- **Enhanced User Interface:** Consider refining the user interface to improve aesthetics and user experience.
- **Data Persistence:** Implement data storage mechanisms to persistently store contacts between application sessions.
- **Additional Features:** Explore the addition of new features, such as contact grouping, sorting options, or exporting/importing contact lists.
